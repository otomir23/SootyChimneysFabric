This is an **unofficial** port of [Sooty Chimneys](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sooty-chimneys) over to Fabric.

Adds Brick, Stone Brick, Terracotta and Copper chimneys, that emit smoke particles.

## Features:
### Soot
After some time, chimney will be covered in soot and become dirty. Scrape with axe to clean it.

Scraping soot from chimney will drop a Black Dye, but not always.

### Wind

Chimney smoke is influenced by wind direction and strength. Wind is stronger in the rain and thunder, and calmer in the evening.

(this works on Sooty Chimneys smoke only)

### Redstone Control

When chimney receives redstone signal it will stop emitting smoke.

### Smoke Blocking

Right click chimney with an empty hand to toggle flow of the smoke.
